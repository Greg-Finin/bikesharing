# Module 14 Deliverable 3

## Overall Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to observe various data about the use of Citibikes in NYC to help make future decisions about Citibike usage. We wanted to gather as much information as we could, and to display the data in a meaningful way, so that we could come to understand how people use Citibike. 
### Tableau Story
Below is the link to the story we created in Tableau, which contains all of the visualizations we made when reviewing the data. Each visualization has a brief description beneath it.

### Final Analysis
The two biggest things we learned from this analysis is that men are far more likely to check out citibikes, and that they usually like to do so on Thursday or Fridady afternoons. When deciding to take citibike to other cities, such as Des Moines, this data could be used to generate questions and further research about the population. Another visualization that could be helpful would be to look at one time customers versus returning customers, to see if once people start using citibikes if they are more or less likely to continue using them. You could further break down that visualization by gender, giving you a good idea for preferences for each gender. If Des Moines would want to implement a citibike system, they would have to compare the data we found with the population/tendencies of their own citizens to see if it would be beneficial.
